# 👨‍💻 Zaman Hüseyinli

Hello! I'm **Zaman Hüseyinli**, a passionate software developer with over **10 years of experience**, beginning my journey at the age of 7. My deep interest in **cybersecurity** started when I was 12, and ever since, I’ve worked tirelessly to grow my skills in both **software development** and **system architecture**.

## 🧠 My Philosophy
From the beginning, I’ve believed that **standards create dependency**, and true progress requires breaking free from them. That’s why all my projects aim to be **innovative**, **independent**, and **free-thinking** — laying the groundwork for technologies that can thrive beyond the limitations of traditional systems.

## 🏛️ Foundations

- **Azencompiler Open Source Foundation** (Founded at age 15)  
  A visionary initiative to foster open, system-independent software. Unfortunately, it was discontinued due to financial constraints.

- **Azccriminal** (Resurrected at age 16)  
  More than just a rebirth — **Azccriminal** is an evolved ecosystem that not only isolates software but empowers it to operate completely independently from any system. It also includes software that works in perfect harmony with existing environments.

## 🚀 My Mission

I strive to **contribute to humanity** and the open source world by crafting tools, ecosystems, and machines that enable true **technological independence**. I believe in opening the door to **new ideas and paradigms** by freeing development from systemic constraints.

Let’s shape the future — one truly independent system at a time.
